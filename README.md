# shades

A Scss mixin library developed mostly from
[nightshades](https://github.com/emilyhorsman/nightshades-react).

Iâ€™m tired of repeating myself across projects. This is a mixin library to
solve that for my own purposes, but others may find this useful.

## Some opinions

* Take care of browser prefixing in post-processing.
* Generally follow the airbnb CSS [style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css)

## Install it

```
$ bower install shades
```

or

```
$ bower install git://github.com/emilyhorsman/shades.git
```

## Lint it

```
$ bundle install
$ scss-lint
```
